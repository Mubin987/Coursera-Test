        <h1 class="mt ms-0">COVID-19</h1>
        <div>COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019.</div>
        <div>The virus, which is believed to have originated in bats, has since spread rapidly across the globe, causing a pandemic that has affected millions of people and led to widespread health, economic, and social impacts.</div>
        <h3 class="mt-4 ">How it Spreads</h3>
        <div>The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets that are expelled when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can enter the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth of a nearby person, or be inhaled into their lungs. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, although this is less common. Asymptomatic people can also spread the virus.</div>
